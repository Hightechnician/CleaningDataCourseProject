#Introduction
Samsung carried out a experiments with a group of 30 volunteers. Each person performed six activities wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. With its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, some datas are captured. For both traing set and test set, 561-feature vector  with time and frequency domain variables are generated by analysing the raw data,  

The run_analysis.R script in this repo analyses the feature data for both training and test sets and generates a "result.txt file" which records the average of mean and standard deviation for each activity and each volunteer.

#Usage
source("run_analysis.R")
analysis()

#Details
The analysis() includes 5 steps of work:
*Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
*Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
*Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
*Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
*Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
