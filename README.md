#Introduction
Samsung carried out a experiments with a group of 30 volunteers. Each person performed six activities wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. With its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, some datas are captured. For both traing set and test set, 561-feature vector  with time and frequency domain variables are generated by analysing the raw data,  

The run_analysis.R script in this repo analyses the feature data for both training and test sets. For each activity and each volunteer, tt calculates the  average of mean and standard deviation for each measurement. It finally records the result in "result.txt file". 

#Usage
source("run_analysis.R")

analysis()

#Details
The calculation in the function analysis() includes 5 steps of work:

1.  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4.  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5.  Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
